I gained so much knowledge about web technologies I was exposed to daily, but knew little about. Even things I did have some knowledge about, like deployment, were enriched through the bootcamp—now I know about other services I can use to deploy apps more quickly as well as knowledge about how to utilize webhooks to continuously deploy to servers I set up.

The bootcamp is a completely new course compared to past editions, so if you want to learn the new material, you should join again.

You pick the hours that best suit your schedule, and you connect to the students Discord chat where you'll always find people you can talk to, to discuss ideas or clarify some concepts together."

Instead, you find the lessons on a web page and you go through each lesson on your own. The content will be text based. The particular thing about the bootcamp cohort is that you're studying privately, but you're not on your own. You'll have other students you can talk to, ask questions, help each other. All of them are doing the same things you're doing now. And I (the instructor) will be in the Discord chat as much as possible to help everyone during the bootcamp, so that no one gets left behind and we can all complete the course successfully."
